A list of AWS lambdas and lambda-related resources. Hopefully some are even useful.

Please note that there are no guarantees that the functions here are safe to run - you're going to have to test them yourself.

## Frameworks

### [apex](http://apex.run/)

Apex lets you use languages that are not natively supported by AWS Lambda, such as Golang, through the use of a Node.js shim injected into the build. A variety of workflow related tooling is provided for testing functions, rolling back deploys, viewing metrics, tailing logs, hooking into the build system and more.

### [chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice)

Chalice is Amazon's python serverless microframework for AWS. It allows you to quickly create and deploy applications that use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.

### [python-lambda](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda)

A toolkit for developing and deploying serverless Python code in AWS Lambda. The Python-Lambda library takes away the guess work of developing your Python-Lambda services by providing you a toolset to streamline the annoying parts.

### [Serverless](http://www.serverless.com)

Build web, mobile and IoT applications with serverless architectures using AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google CloudFunctions & more!

## Functions

* [pricing-tools](https://github.com/concurrencylabs/aws-pricing-tools) - A Lambda function that calculates near real-time price of an account's infrastructure including EC2, ELB, EBS, RDS, Lambda, Dynamo DB and Kinesis resources.
* [reaper-lambda](https://github.com/gabinante/reaper-lambda) - Reaps any and all instances which are not tagged with an expiration date.

## Other Resources

* [iron-io/lambda](https://github.com/iron-io/lambda) - A set of tools, tests and libraries to convert Amazon AWS Lambda functions into Docker images that can run on any computer or cloud provider.
