A list of AWS lambdas and lambda-related resources. Hopefully some are even useful.

Please note that there are no guarantees that the functions here are safe to run - you're going to have to test them yourself.

This list is under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/unixorn/aws-lambda-list/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Frameworks

### [apex](http://apex.run/)

Apex lets you use languages that are not natively supported by AWS Lambda, such as Golang, through the use of a Node.js shim injected into the build. A variety of workflow related tooling is provided for testing functions, rolling back deploys, viewing metrics, tailing logs, hooking into the build system and more.

### [chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice)

Chalice is Amazon's python serverless microframework for AWS. It allows you to quickly create and deploy applications that use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.

### [dawson-cli](https://github.com/dawson-org/dawson-cli)

A serverless web framework for Node.js on AWS (CloudFormation, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda). More details at [https://dawson.sh](https://dawson.sh).

### [Hexaville](https://github.com/noppoMan/Hexaville)

Hexaville is a serverless framework for Swift using AWS Lambda + ApiGateway etc as a back end. Build applications in Swift comprised of microservices that run in response to events, automatically scale to meet demand, and only charge for time actually spent running.

### [power-jambda](https://github.com/visionarts/power-jambda)

A java serverless microframework for RESTful API that allows you to quickly develop applications that use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.

### [python-lambda](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda)

A toolkit for developing and deploying serverless Python code in AWS Lambda. The Python-Lambda library takes away the guess work of developing your Python-Lambda services by providing you a toolset to streamline the annoying parts.

### [python-lambdarest](https://github.com/trustpilot/python-lambdarest)

Python routing mini-framework for AWS Lambda with optional JSON-schema validation.

Features:
* lambda_handler function constructor with built-in dispatcher
* Decorator to register functions to handle HTTP methods
* Optional JSON-schema input validation using same decorator

### [Pyverless](https://github.com/QuantumBA/pyverless)

Pyverless is a mini-framework with a bunch of utilities that aims to help you create APIs using AWS Lambdas fast and in a consistent way. Pyverless provides the following:

* Class-Based Handlers
* Serializers
* Authentication handling
* JWT and cryptography
* Exceptions
* Configuration
* Warmup handling

### [Rumbda](https://github.com/kleaver/rumbda)

Rumbda does everything necessary to build a zip file for running ruby inside of an AWS Lambda. This includes downloading [traveling ruby](https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby), creating a bundle of the project's Gemfile dependencies, and creating a consumable .zip file for use with Lambda.

### [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com)

Build web, mobile and IoT applications with serverless architectures using AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google CloudFunctions & more!

### [Serverless Golang](https://github.com/yunspace/serverless-golang)

AWS Lambda Go functions using Serverless Framework and a Python shim.

### [Up](https://github.com/apex/up)

Up focuses on deploying "vanilla" HTTP servers so there's nothing new to learn, just develop with your favorite existing frameworks such as Express, Koa, Django, Golang net/http or others.

Up currently supports Node.js, Golang, Python, Java, Crystal, and static sites out of the box. Up is platform-agnostic, supporting AWS Lambda and API Gateway as the first targets. You can think of Up as self-hosted Heroku style user experience for a fraction of the price, with the security, flexibility, and scalability of AWS.

### [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa)

Zappa makes it super easy to build and deploy server-less, event-driven Python applications (including, but not limited to, WSGI web apps) on AWS Lambda + API Gateway.

## Functions & Applications

Both single functions and Applications composed of multiple serverless functions
