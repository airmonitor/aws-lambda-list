A list of AWS lambdas and lambda-related resources. Hopefully some are even useful.

Please note that there are no guarantees that the functions here are safe to run - you're going to have to test them yourself.

This list is under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/unixorn/aws-lambda-list/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Frameworks

### [apex](http://apex.run/)

Apex lets you use languages that are not natively supported by AWS Lambda, such as Golang, through the use of a Node.js shim injected into the build. A variety of workflow related tooling is provided for testing functions, rolling back deploys, viewing metrics, tailing logs, hooking into the build system and more.

### [chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice)

Chalice is Amazon's python serverless microframework for AWS. It allows you to quickly create and deploy applications that use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.

### [python-lambda](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda)

A toolkit for developing and deploying serverless Python code in AWS Lambda. The Python-Lambda library takes away the guess work of developing your Python-Lambda services by providing you a toolset to streamline the annoying parts.

### [Serverless](http://www.serverless.com)

Build web, mobile and IoT applications with serverless architectures using AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google CloudFunctions & more!

### [Serverless Golang](https://github.com/yunspace/serverless-golang)

AWS Lambda Go functions using Serverless Framework and a Python shim.

## Functions

* [pricing-tools](https://github.com/concurrencylabs/aws-pricing-tools) - A Lambda function that calculates near real-time price of an account's infrastructure including EC2, ELB, EBS, RDS, Lambda, Dynamo DB and Kinesis resources.
* [reaper-lambda](https://github.com/gabinante/reaper-lambda) - Reaps any and all instances which are not tagged with an expiration date.

## Other Resources

* [aws-sam-local](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local) - `sam` is the AWS CLI tool for managing Serverless applications written with [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model). SAM Local can be used to test functions locally, start a local API Gateway from a SAM template, validate a SAM template, and generate sample payloads for various event sources.
* [binaryalert](https://github.com/airbnb/binaryalert) - Serverless, Real-time & Retroactive Malware Detection.
* [iron-io/lambda](https://github.com/iron-io/lambda) - A set of tools, tests and libraries to convert Amazon AWS Lambda functions into Docker images that can run on any computer or cloud provider.
* [Lambda Tutorial: Lambda + Serverless = HAPPY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71cd5XerKss)
* [Learning Lambda](https://blog.symphonia.io/learning-lambda-1f25af64161c) - Mike Roberts' series on learning to use Lambda
