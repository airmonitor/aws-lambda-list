# aws-lambda-list

A list of AWS lambdas and lambda-related resources. Hopefully some are even useful.

Please note that there are no guarantees that the functions here are safe to run - you're going to have to test them yourself.

This list is under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/unixorn/aws-lambda-list/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Functions

* [pricing-tools](https://github.com/concurrencylabs/aws-pricing-tools) - A Lambda function that calculates near real-time price of an account's infrastructure including EC2, ELB, EBS, RDS, Lambda, Dynamo DB and Kinesis resources.
* [reaper-lambda](https://github.com/gabinante/reaper-lambda) - Reaps any and all instances which are not tagged with an expiration date.

## Frameworks

* [apex](http://apex.run/) - Apex lets you use languages that are not natively supported by AWS Lambda, such as Golang, through the use of a Node.js shim injected into the build. A variety of workflow related tooling is provided for testing functions, rolling back deploys, viewing metrics, tailing logs, hooking into the build system and more.
* [python-lambda](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda) - A toolkit for developing and deploying serverless Python code in AWS Lambda. The Python-Lambda library takes away the guess work of developing your Python-Lambda services by providing you a toolset to streamline the annoying parts.
